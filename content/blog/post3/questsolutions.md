_Steps to acing the AWS — Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) Exam — CLF-C01_

## Introduction

I recently cleared the AWS- Cloud Quest Cloud Practitioner in June 2023 and thought of sharing my the experience and the path I took to complete this. AWS Cloud Quest is an open-world, role-playing game that teaches you how to create AWS solutions using cloud concepts and exercises based on real life. It helps you learn the intricacies of modern cloud technologies and have fun at the same time. Cloud Quest features 12 real-life scenario assignments which prepare and train you to become an AWS Cloud Practitioner at absolutely no cost. This free game targets audiences that are new to Cloud Computing and people who want to learn the basics of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## AWS Cloud Quest Essentials Topics

The 12 real-life scenario assignment labs include:
1. Highly Available Web Applications 
2. Networking Concepts
3. File Systems in the Cloud
4. Core Security Concepts
5. Cloud Computing Essentials
6. Connecting VPCs
7. First NoSQL Database
8. Cloud Economics 
9. Databases in Practice 
10. Auto-Healing and Scaling Architecture
11. Computing Solutions 
12. Cloud First Steps
13. DNS 
14. Analyzing Network Traffic
15. Single-Page App
16. Container Services 
17. Decoupling Applications
18. Auto-Healing and Scaling Applications
19. Resource Monitoring 
20. Content Delivery Networks
21. Backing up Data
22. Deploying RESTful APIs
23. Serverless Foundations 
24. API with Database
25. Automation with CloudFormation
26. Resource Governance


In the next sections I'll cover 4 main areas in terms of interface and world (it is a game after all), content and quests (how does the knowledge align with the game), user interaction and performance (how does the system and environment perform) and learning experience (how effective is it in teaching cloud concepts and practice). Followed by an overall summary of the review and recommendation compared to some other AWS free education programs.

When you come to the Solution Center to build the solution and complete the quest, you have 4 steps you need to go through:
- Learn
- Plan
- Practice
- DIY
## 1: Learn

In the learn section you can interact with a diagram of the solution you build and can watch videos of the concepts and services that you will use. I must admit, the diagram was really helpful and gets new to cloud learners used to the concept of solution or architecture diagrams as well as explain what the services are and the way they function.

The less great part of this step was the factt that at times the videos took long to load, therefore give it time  for the videos to load then watch them. They help one understand the services in the lab and give insights. I highly recommend you watch them even though there might be a glitch or a lag.

## 2: Plan

In the plan section you will use the architecture diagram to creatively come up with the solution for the challenge. It displays the practice lab goals in which this section gives the steps to follow to achieve the goal and the DIY goals where one does this section using the knowledge gained.

## 3: Practice

This is the interactive hands-on area. Here, you will get to implement an initial solution using the actual AWS Management Console itself. It will provide you with an AWS Console session that will expire in 2 hours and 30 minutes. Just as the name of this section implies, this part is mainly for practicing the steps for the final solution that you will implement in the next section.

Once you click open AWS console button a new tab will open and you will be directed to the AWS Management Consol homepage.

When you are through with the hands on section, this image will be dipslayed showing you've finished the section. Click on the DIY button to go to the next step.

## 4: DIY
This is the final part of the Solution Center. Here, you apply your own solution based on the learnings that you have acquired in the Practice section.

## Conclusion
AWS made learning Cloud fun to learn and one can learn maybe on lunch breaks or even on your free time. This game gives you a good amount of information about AWS Cloud and is both entertaining and interactive at the same time. Again, this is free to play for everyone and all you need is an Amazon account. I think AWS did a great job in developing the game, making it highly interactive and user-friendly.
